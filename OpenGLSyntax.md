# Vertex
- glVertex2f(floatX, floatY) // Where in the space should this point be? (2f is for float, but integer & double and many more also exists).

# Color
- glColor3f(floatR, floatG, floatB) // RGB - This really doesn't need any explanations.
- glColor4f(floatR, floatG, floatB, floatA) // RGBA - This really doesn't need any explanations besides it also uses the "Alpha channel".

# Rotate
- glRotatef(floatAngle, floatX, floatY, floatZ) - Hold my hand.
