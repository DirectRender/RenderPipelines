# OpenGL (1992)
> Pros
- OpenGL is a cross-platform graphics API, which means it can be used on a variety of platforms, including Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and embedded systems.
- OpenGL is fast and efficient. It is optimized for hardware acceleration and its code is highly optimized for performance.
- OpenGL is powerful and feature-rich. It includes a wide range of features for creating realistic 3D graphics, such as lighting, shading, textures, and shadows.
- OpenGL is easy to learn and use. There are many tutorials and resources available online to help developers learn the basics quickly.
> Cons
- OpenGL is not as popular as other graphics APIs, such as DirectX or Vulkan. Game Engines perfer DirectX or Vulkan over OpenGL.
- It does not have as many features as DirectX or Vulkan, which can make it more difficult to create complex 3D graphics.
- OpenGL is not as well supported by hardware manufacturers, which means that some hardware may not be able to support the latest features of OpenGL.
- The API is not as well documented as other graphics APIs, which can make it more difficult to learn and use.

# Vulkan (2016)
> Pros
- Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform 3D graphics and compute API.
- Vulkan provides high performance with significantly reduced driver overhead.
- Vulkan simplifies parallel computation by providing tools for efficient multi-threaded rendering.
- Vulkan is supported on many platforms and devices, including Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS.
- Vulkan provides an easy-to-use interface that can be easily integrated with existing graphics engines and applications.
> Cons
- Vulkan requires a more complex setup than OpenGL.
- Vulkan may require additional hardware support for certain features.
- Vulkan may require additional development time and effort to integrate with existing codebases.
- Vulkan is a relatively new API, and so there is less community support and fewer resources available to help developers get up and running.


# DirectX (1995)
> Pros
- DirectX is designed to take advantage of the advanced hardware features found on modern graphics cards.
- DirectX allows developers to create more immersive and interactive gaming experiences, with realistic 3D visuals, dynamic lighting, and enhanced audio.
- DirectX includes a set of tools and libraries which make it easier for developers to create high-performance applications.
- DirectX is widely used in game development, allowing games to run on a variety of hardware configurations and still be able to use the same APIs.
> Cons
- DirectX can be difficult to learn due to its complexity.
- DirectX requires the use of specialized hardware, such as graphics cards, which can be expensive.
- DirectX is only available on Windows, limiting its use in cross-platform development.
- DirectX may not be supported by older hardware, and may not be compatible with certain software.
